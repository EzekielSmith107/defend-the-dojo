            <h3>Defend the Dojo</h3>
            <p>Since the reign of the Mountain King, the land has been peaceful for centuries. But now, everything has changed since the fire spirits have attacked.
                With strange omens and natural disasters happening on the daily, the people of the village Bumboro are uneasy. With a long tradition of training some of the best ninjas in the area, the villagers prepare for the worst. While out gathering mushrooms, a local medicine man reports seeing dangerous foes approaching. <br>
                Prepare to Defend the Dojo, for the village and its secrets must not fall into the hands of the enemy.
